# 🧠 Learning Web Development: The Generation Journey

Welcome to my development hub. This repository documents my transition from **Recognition** (understanding code) to **Generation** (building from scratch). It follows the **"Generation Mode Learning Contract"**—a commitment to manual typing, architectural planning (Box-Logic), and professional implementation.

## 🧰 The Toolbox (Current Focus)
The **Toolbox** is a professional central hub where I implement scalable, themed, and production-ready tools using the T3 stack (Next.js, Drizzle, Tailwind v4, TypeScript).

**🌐 Live Demo:** [learning-web-development-gx7o.vercel.app](https://learning-web-development-gx7o.vercel.app/)

### 🚀 Featured Tools:
#### **Codeforces Investigation Tool**
- **Live API Integration:** Fetches and deduplicates solved problems for any handle.
- **Rating Graph:** Interactive normalized bar charts with elegant tooltips.
- **Master-Detail Organization:** Grouped problem sets by rating with live filtering.
- **The "Wires":** Clickable badges for direct submissions and real-time handle search.

### 🎨 The "SepiaDog" Aesthetic
The entire toolbox is styled with a custom Linux-inspired professional dark theme:
- **Backgrounds:** `#0D0D0D` / `#1C1C1C`
- **Primary Text:** `#B9986F` (Beige)
- **Accents:** `#E6C07B` (Gold), `#B35433` (Terra Cotta)

## 🏛️ Foundations (The Learning Archive)

### [React Basics](./React/react-basics)
Progressive learning from simple state to complex dashboards.
- **Day 1-4:** State, Props, `useEffect`, and Form Validation.
- **Day 5-7:** Mini-apps (SimpleSocial), Responsive Grids, and Final Dashboards.

### [JavaScript Fundamentals](./JavaScript)
The "Muscle Memory" drills organized by topic.
- **Logic & Loops:** Conditionals, for/while iterations.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Objects, and Map/Filter manipulations.
- **Asynchronous JS:** Fetch API, Async/Await, and modern syntax (Destructuring/Spread).

## 🛡️ The Learning Philosophy
This project is guided by specific rules to kill "Tutorial Fatigue":
1. **The Rule of 15:** 15 minutes of independent struggle before seeking hints.
2. **Box-Logic Habit:** Planning the **Box** (Component), **Memory** (State), and **Wires** (Data Flow) before writing a single line of JSX.
3. **Manual Override:** Strictly NO copy-pasting. Every line is manually re-typed to build muscle memory.
